### Issue summary

DO NOT report installation issues until you have reviewed the docker build files in https://github.com/gnina/gnina/tree/master/docker
You should also evaluate using the pre-built executable (https://github.com/gnina/gnina/releases). The reason it exists is so you do not have to build gnina yourself.

If the current docker builds are not broken, then it is your responsibility to understand how your system deviates from a standard configuration.  Please *do* report issues installing into a vanilla Ubuntu LTS image or using newer versions of CUDA.

Please close issues when they are resolved.

### Steps to reproduce
